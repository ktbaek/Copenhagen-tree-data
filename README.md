# Cleaning, QC of Copenhagen's municipal tree dataset

## Data source

The dataset from KÃ¸benhavns Kommune was downloaded from [Open Data DK](https://www.opendata.dk/city-of-copenhagen/trae-basis-kommunale-traeer) in September 2025. It contains information about ~67,000 trees in Copenhagen. The data (not included here) is licensed under `CC-BY-4.0`.

## Cleaning steps

- Check for duplicate UUIDs
- Flag entries with identical locations
- Check that year of planting is within an expected range
- Normalize hybrid markers (e.g. `x` to `hybr.`)
- Normalize cultivar quotes (e.g. `"` to `'`)
- Fix mistakes in scientific names (e.g. spelling, diacritics, missing species epiphet in cultivars, missing hybrid markers) according to [these rules](rules/latin_regex.csv)
- Fix mistakes in Danish names (e.g. spelling, capitalization, compound words) according to [these rules](rules/da_regex.csv)
- Separate scientific names into their logical components
- Fix Danish names based on the scientific name (incl. special Danish names for cultivars and variants) according to [these](rules/latin_da_map.csv) and [these](rules/latin_da_map_malus.csv) rules
- Fix Danish genus names based on the scientific name according to [these rules](rules/genus_dict.csv)


The last two steps assume that the scientific names are the ground truth. This is probably true in the vast majority of cases, but without knowing the history of the dataset it can't be known for certain.

The rule sets are not complete, but reflect an ongoing effort.

So far, ~20,000 changes (548 unique) have been made to the original dataset. In some cases one correction will be counted as several corrections because it results from different rules being applied one at a time e.g. Park-Lind to Park-lind to Parklind. All changes have been recorded in a [changelog](output/).


## Online Shiny-app

I used the cleaned and quality controlled dataset to develop an [interactive map](https://ktbaek.shinyapps.io/treemap_basic/) as a handy tool to explore the trees of Copenhagen. Go check it out, it's really great!
